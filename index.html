                In this project, we are exploring movies data base from IMDB. There are a lot of factors
                to consider, such as the director, the actors, and the movie’s budget so on.
                We will explore few data set in this project.
                IMDB data collected from <a href="https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/">IMBD interfaces</a>. The data is
                minimally cleaned up by filtering for movies that have at least one vote and associated rating information,
                and info on TV episodes or shows is also not included, but the data is otherwise directly (after parsing)
                from IMDB.

                <h4>About IMDB</h4>
                IMDb, an abbreviation of Internet Movie Database, is an online database of information related to world films, television programs, home videos and video games, and internet streams, including cast, production crew and personnel biographies, plot summaries, trivia, and fan reviews and ratings. An additional fan feature, message boards, was abandoned in February 2017. Originally a fan-operated website, the database is owned and operated by IMDb.com, Inc., a subsidiary of Amazon
                <br>
                As of December 2017, IMDb has approximately 4.7 million titles (including episodes) and 8.3 million personalities in its database, as well as 83 million registered users.

            <h1 align="center">IMDB Yearly Movie And Genre Counts (1915-2013)</h1>
            <div class="exposition">
                As you can see this chart visualizes the number of genre movie releases between 1915 and 2013, as well as the total number of movies in those years. A single movie may be associated with zero, one, or multiple genres and so the 'Total Movies' line corresponds to actual movie counts and every colored-in area represents the number of movies tagged with that genre for that year. The clear conclusion is that there has been an explosion in film production from the 90s onward, for which I have some theories but no definitive explanation. Beyond the big takeaway there are a multitude of possible smaller conclusions regarding the relative popularity of genres and movies overall, which was really my intent in making such an open-ended visualization.

                There is a ton more that can be done with the data. The direction I decided to
                go with it was to explore various aspects of more recent data rather than
                more aspects related to change over time. I would love to eventually add controls to view any year range for
                all the following charts, but they still reveal some interesting aspects about modern movie production and
                IMDB metrics.

            <h1 align="center">Conclusion</h1>
            <div class="exposition">
                Based upon above graphs, we have noticed that movies production had increased in early 2000. It is continue to increase due technology was re-evaluated once studios discovered lucrative sales and rentals from taped versions of their commercially-released movies. VHS video players, laser disc players and the release of films on videocassette tapes and discs multiplied as prices plummeted, creating a new industry and adding substantial revenue and profits for the movie studios. All of the major Hollywood studios had their own video divisions and by the late ’90s in the U.S., income from video rentals was double that of the theatrical box office.
                <br><br>
                However, according to user rating we have noticed that most movies are rated as mediocre/good and the frequency flattens out at either extreme. So there is lot of scope for movie industry to improve movie quality then quantity.
